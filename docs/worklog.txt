Project Overview
Name: Tauri app builder
Description: 
The Tauri Web app client builder project aims to create a Dockerfile that compile Tauri lightweight web apps (clients) for Windows.  

Project requirements:
- Create a watertight "recipe" for building lightweight web app clients that can be easily compiled using a Dockerfile.
    - The build process should be done in isolated environment
    - Docker container host OS during the build process is not limited to Windows
    - The output of build process should be Windows executable file
 
The project's primary goal is to create a watertight "recipe" for building lightweight web app clients that can be easily
compiled using a Dockerfile. Builded container should be as "factory of executables": tauri-app source as input and builded 
Windows executable as output.

Objectives: 
- Create Docekrfile that builds a web application for Windows using Tauri framework
- The project build process will not involve using online services for compilation or assuming that the host OS is Windows

Deliverables:
- A Dockerfile for compiling the lightweight web app using Tauri framework 
- Documentation on how to build the "factory" container and build tauri client using that "factory"
- The source code for the project


Functional Requirements:
- The system should be able to compile a lightweight web app client using a Dockerfile despite the host OS.

Non-functional Requirements:
- The system should be built in isolated environment using Dockerfile
- The build process should not use online services for compilation and not assume that the host OS is Windows.

3. Design

Dockerfile produces an image based on the rust:alpine base image will. The build tools, cross-compiler and targets 
for applications for the windows_x86_64 platform are installed during image build process.

The actual tauri application compilation is done during container execution.

The interaction of the host OS with the container will occur through the shared volume mechanism. The folder with the source 
code of the application (input) and the folder with the compilation result (output).

[Worklog]

I need to pack all the steps for setting up the rust environment and the build process of the executable file 
from the source code of the tauri application in a Dockerfile. 

The main difficulty is setting up a crossplatform toolchain for compiling and building inside an isolated container environment. 
Since I settled on the MinGW compiler and linker, i need to add them to the environment before starting the actual tauri app build process. 
After that build environment for tauri app compilation will be encapsulated inside the image. That build environment will be used
on container execution and will build tauri app like any other Rust application.


Known limitations:
[WebView2Loader.dll]

A binary library WebView2Loader from the WebView2 SDK need to be used, either the DLL WebView2Loader.dll or the static library 
WebView2LoaderStatic.lib. 

This brings some complexities:
* When using the msvc toolchain, the static library is used. 
* When using the gnu toolchain, the static library does not seem to work so the WebView2Loader.dll DLL is used. 
    You need to make sure that the DLL can be loaded at runtime, e.g. by putting it alongside the built exe files.

Docker linux containers should be used because rust docker images does not have windows/amd64 support.
Dockerfile builder stage moved rust: alpine dokcer image

This build process should be divided into 2 steps:
1. Preparing the build environment for tauri applications
2. Direct assembly of the tauri application itself
